# gRPC Mutual TLS (mTLS) with a Private CA üõ°Ô∏è

Hey there! This project is a hands-on Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrating how to secure a gRPC service using **Mutual TLS (mTLS)** with your very own private **Certificate Authority (CA)**.

This isn't just about standard encryption (like when your browser connects to a website). This is a zero-trust setup where the server only talks to clients it trusts, and the client only talks to the server it trusts. Both sides must prove their identity using cryptographic certificates issued by our private CA.

## How It All Works (The Core Idea)

Imagine a top-secret private club. You can't just show up and get in.

1.  **The Club Owner (Our Certificate Authority):** There's one person‚Äîthe club owner‚Äîwho issues special, unforgeable ID cards. This is our **CA**.
2.  **The Bouncer (The gRPC Server):** The bouncer at the door has an official ID card from the owner. This is the **server certificate**. When you walk up, the bouncer shows you their ID to prove they're legit.
3.  **You (The gRPC Client):** You also have a special ID card from the same club owner. This is the **client certificate**.
4.  **The Handshake (mTLS):**
    * You show up at the club. The bouncer shows you their ID (`server.crt`). You check it and see it was signed by the club owner (`ca.crt`), so you trust them.
    * Now, the bouncer demands to see *your* ID (`client.crt`).
    * The bouncer checks your ID and sees it was *also* signed by the club owner (`ca.crt`). They trust you.
    * The door opens, and you can communicate securely.

If either side presents an ID from a different "club owner" (another CA) or has no ID at all, the connection is immediately rejected.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have these installed:

* **Java 21+** (JDK)
* **Gradle** 8.x
* **OpenSSL** (for generating certificates)

## üöÄ Let's Get It Running!

Follow these steps from the root directory of the project (`mtls/`).

### Step 1: Generate All Certificates and Keys

This is the most important step. We'll create a temporary folder, generate all the crypto files there, and then copy them where they need to go.

Run this entire block in your terminal from the project root:

```bash
# Create a clean, temporary directory for our crypto files
mkdir -p temp-certs
cd temp-certs

# 1. Create our private Certificate Authority (CA)
echo "üîë Generating CA Key and Certificate..."
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out ca.key
openssl req -new -x509 -key ca.key -out ca.crt -days 365 -subj "/CN=My Private CA"

# 2. Create the Server's Key and Certificate (signed by our CA)
# The Common Name (CN) MUST be "localhost" for this demo to work!
echo "üñ•Ô∏è  Generating Server Key and Certificate for localhost..."
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out server.key
openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr -subj "/CN=localhost"
openssl x509 -req -in server.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out server.crt -days 365

# 3. Create the Client's Key and Certificate (signed by our CA)
echo "üë§ Generating Client Key and Certificate..."
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out client.key
openssl req -new -key client.key -out client.csr -subj "/CN=grpc-client"
openssl x509 -req -in client.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out client.crt -days 365

# 4. Convert the private keys to the PKCS#8 format that Java prefers
echo "üîÑ Converting keys to PKCS#8 format..."
openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -in server.key -outform PEM -nocrypt -out server.p8.key
openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -in client.key -outform PEM -nocrypt -out client.p8.key

echo "‚úÖ All files generated successfully in the 'temp-certs' directory!"
cd ..
````

### Step 2: Copy the Files to the Projects

Now, copy the necessary files from `temp-certs` into the server and client resource folders.

```bash
# For the server
cp temp-certs/ca.crt temp-certs/server.crt temp-certs/server.p8.key modules/grpc-mtls-server/src/main/resources/certs/

# For the client
cp temp-certs/ca.crt temp-certs/client.crt temp-certs/client.p8.key modules/grpc-mtls-client/src/main/resources/certs/
```

### Step 3: Build the Entire Project

Let Gradle compile everything and prepare the applications.

```bash
./gradlew clean build
```

### Step 4: Run the Server and Client

You'll need **two separate terminal windows** for this.

**In Terminal 1 - Start the Server:**

```bash
./gradlew :modules:grpc-mtls-server:bootRun
```

Wait for the server to start. You'll see the log message:
`‚úÖ gRPC mTLS Server Started on port 9090...`

**In Terminal 2 - Run the Client:**

```bash
./gradlew :modules:grpc-mtls-client:bootRun
```

## What Success Looks Like ‚úÖ

If everything is configured correctly, your client terminal will spring to life and show the successful response from the server\!

```text
Sending request to server with name: Gemini

--- RESPONSE FROM SERVER ---
Hello, Gemini! Your request was secured with mTLS. üõ°Ô∏è
----------------------------

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
```

Pretty cool, right? You've just run a fully authenticated, zero-trust communication channel between two services. Happy hacking\!
